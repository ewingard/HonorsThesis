# MISC Code for The Impact of Biases within Facial Recognition Neural Networks

### Within this folder, there's misc code used for my Honors Thesis
  - datasplitter.py =splits a dataset into 2 halves (training, validation). This didn't end up having to be used, but it already was written so feel free to use if it may help! 
     * Be sure to change paths BEFORE using!*
  - csv-creator = creates a csv containing the paths of all your images. can be used to create a test set to feed into the predict.py neural net script! It's honestly nothing fancy, but it worked :)
  - scraper.py = code that was used to scrape images from hashtags off of Instagram. Follow the comments within the file to scrape images using hashtags yourself!
 *MUST DOWNLOAD THE INSTALOADER PACKAGE FIRST BEFORE USING!!*
